# Catch-Me-If-You-Can
This is a front-end mini Project build using HTML , Css and javascript.
This include a div which is never able to be clicked due to operations applied to it using javascript , This is the reason it is named as catch me if you can as it sounds 
like a challenge and makes it more interesting.
Enjoy this project!!
